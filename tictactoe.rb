# only accept available squares on user choice. complain if not available.

# AI for computer to choose best square. Hint: think about how to make the computer smarter. To start, the computer should prefer to block any square that may allow 3 in a row. How about a method called two_in_a_row that returns either nil or the square to block if thereâ€™s two in a row.
